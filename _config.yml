aboutUs: "The Plasma Science and Fusion Technology (PSFT) Group at the University of Seville aims at making fusion energy a reality for our society. A clean, sustainable and virtually unlimited energy source makes fusion the scientific and engineering challenge of the 21st century. The PSFT group seeks to answer some of the most important questions on the fusion energy quest. Based on cutting-edge technologies and state-of-the-art numerical codes, we aim at getting a better understanding of energetic particle and plasma edge physics; key areas in the development of a high confinement, self maintained burning plasma. The development of new diagnostics and experimental approaches for the most relevant experimental fusion reactors worldwide form the basis of our research. The PSFT research mission is completed with the training of the new generation of fusion scientists and engineers."

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
